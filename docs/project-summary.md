# Program Manager Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Program Manager is a comprehensive web-based tool designed for managing executable programs and shell scripts on Linux platforms. This project provides a complete solution for organizing, controlling, and monitoring programs through an intuitive web interface.

## Completed Design Documents

The following design documents have been completed as part of this architectural phase:

1. **README.md** - Project overview and basic information
2. **docs/architecture-overview.md** - High-level system architecture and design decisions
3. **docs/data-model.md** - Detailed data model design and validation rules
4. **docs/api-design.md** - Complete RESTful API specification
5. **docs/web-interface.md** - Web UI layout and user experience design
6. **docs/status-monitoring.md** - Process status detection and monitoring mechanisms
7. **docs/data-persistence.md** - Data storage and import/export functionality

## Key Features Implemented in Design

### Program Management
- Add, edit, delete programs with detailed information
- Store program metadata (name, command, working directory, description)
- Unique identification for each program

### Status Monitoring
- Real-time monitoring of program execution status
- Process validation using Linux `/proc` filesystem
- Manual and automatic status refresh mechanisms
- Visual status indicators in the web interface

### Process Control
- Start programs in background with log generation
- Stop programs and clean up all related processes
- Batch operations for managing multiple programs
- Proper handling of process IDs and status transitions

### Data Persistence
- JSON-based storage for human-readable and editable data
- Atomic file operations to prevent data corruption
- Import/export functionality for backup and migration
- Backup and recovery mechanisms

### Web Interface
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Intuitive program list with status indicators
- Detailed program view with log preview
- Batch operation support
- User-friendly forms for adding/editing programs

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Golang) with standard library
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Data Storage**: JSON files
- **Process Management**: OS-specific process control
- **Communication**: RESTful API over HTTP

## Next Steps

With the architectural design complete, the project is ready for implementation. The implementation phase would involve:

1. Setting up the Go project structure
2. Implementing the data models and storage layer
3. Building the RESTful API endpoints
4. Developing the process management functionality
5. Creating the web interface
6. Implementing status monitoring
7. Adding data persistence features
8. Testing and debugging
9. Documentation and deployment

## Design Decisions

### Why Go?
- Excellent for system-level operations and process management
- Cross-compilation support for different Linux distributions
- Strong standard library for HTTP and JSON handling
- Good performance and low resource usage

### Why JSON Storage?
- Human-readable and editable
- Easy to backup and migrate
- No database dependencies
- Sufficient for single-instance deployments

### Why RESTful API?
- Well-understood architectural style
- Easy to test and debug
- Compatible with various frontend technologies
- Supports future expansion

## Security Considerations

The design incorporates several security measures:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Process isolation
- File permission controls
- Secure file operations
- API authentication (planned for implementation)

## Performance Considerations

The design optimizes for:
- Efficient process status checking
- Minimal system resource usage
- Atomic file operations to prevent corruption
- Concurrent access handling

## Scalability

While designed primarily for single-instance use, the architecture supports:
- Horizontal scaling with shared storage
- Future database integration
- Load balancing for web interface

## Conclusion

The Program Manager project has been thoroughly designed with detailed documentation covering all major aspects of the system. The design is ready for implementation, with clear specifications for developers to follow.
