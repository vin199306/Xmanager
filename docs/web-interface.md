# Web Interface Design

## Overview

The web interface for the Program Manager provides a user-friendly dashboard for managing programs, monitoring their status, and controlling their execution. The interface is built using modern web technologies and follows responsive design principles.

## Layout Structure

The interface is organized into several key areas:

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
|  Header: Application title and global actions     |
+-----------+---------------------------------------+
|  Sidebar  |  Main Content Area                    |
|           |                                       |
|           |                                       |
|           |                                       |
|           |                                       |
|           |                                       |
|           |                                       |
|           |                                       |
