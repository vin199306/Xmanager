# Data Persistence Solution

## Overview

The data persistence solution is responsible for storing and retrieving program information. It provides mechanisms for saving program data to disk, loading it on application startup, and supporting import/export functionality.

## Storage Format

### JSON Format

Program data is stored in JSON format for the following reasons:
- Human-readable and editable
- Widely supported across platforms
- Easy to parse and generate
- Supports hierarchical data structures

### File Structure

The data is stored in a single JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "programs": [
    {
      "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "name": "Nginx Web Server",
      "command": "/usr/sbin/nginx",
      "working_dir": "/etc/nginx",
      "description": "High performance web server",
      "status": "stopped",
      "pid": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### File Location

- Default filename: `programs.json`
- Default location: Application data directory
- Configurable through application settings

## Data Operations

### Load Data

When the application starts:
1. Check if the data file exists
2. If it exists, read and parse the JSON
3. Validate the data structure
4. Load programs into memory
5. If it doesn't exist, initialize with an empty program list

### Save Data

When program data changes:
1. Serialize the program list to JSON
2. Write to a temporary file
3. Atomically rename the temporary file to the data file
4. Handle write errors gracefully

### Backup Strategy

To prevent data loss:
1. Create backup copies before saving
2. Maintain a history of previous versions (configurable number)
3. Validate data before overwriting existing files

## Import/Export Functionality

### Export

1. Serialize current program list to JSON
2. Provide as downloadable file through web interface
3. Support exporting selected programs

### Import

1. Accept uploaded JSON file
2. Validate file structure and data
3. Merge with existing programs:
   - Update existing programs (matching by ID)
   - Add new programs
4. Report import results (number of imported/updated programs)

## Concurrency Handling

### File Locking

To prevent corruption with concurrent access:
1. Use file locking mechanisms when reading/writing
2. Implement retry logic for locked files
3. Handle lock timeouts gracefully

### In-Memory Synchronization

1. Use mutex to protect in-memory program list
2. Ensure atomic operations on program data
3. Minimize lock duration

## Error Handling

### File I/O Errors

1. **Read Errors**:
   - File not found: Initialize with empty program list
   - Permission denied: Log error and exit gracefully
   - Corrupted data: Attempt to recover or exit gracefully

2. **Write Errors**:
   - Disk full: Log error and notify user
   - Permission denied: Log error and continue with in-memory data
   - Other I/O errors: Log error and retry with exponential backoff

### Data Validation

1. Validate JSON structure on load
2. Validate individual program data
3. Handle invalid data gracefully (skip or fix)
4. Log validation errors

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Serialization

1. Use streaming JSON encoder/decoder for large datasets
2. Minimize memory allocations during serialization
3. Cache serialized data when appropriate

### Lazy Loading

1. Load data only when needed
2. Support pagination for large program lists
3. Load program logs on demand

### Batch Operations

1. Batch save operations to reduce I/O
2. Combine multiple changes into single write
3. Use transactions for atomic updates

## Security Considerations

### File Permissions

1. Set appropriate file permissions (readable/writable only by application user)
2. Prevent unauthorized access to data files
3. Encrypt sensitive data if needed

### Data Integrity

1. Validate data on load and save
2. Use checksums to detect corruption
3. Implement rollback mechanisms for failed updates

### Input Sanitization

1. Sanitize imported data
2. Prevent injection attacks through program data
3. Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal

## Backup and Recovery

### Automatic Backups

1. Create backup before each save operation
2. Maintain configurable number of backup copies
3. Timestamp backup files

### Recovery Procedures

1. Detect corrupted data files
2. Automatically restore from backup
3. Provide manual recovery options

### Disaster Recovery

1. Export functionality for full data backup
2. Import functionality for disaster recovery
3. Documentation for recovery procedures

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests

1. JSON serialization/deserialization
2. File I/O operations
3. Data validation logic

### Integration Tests

1. End-to-end data persistence
2. Concurrent access scenarios
3. Error handling and recovery

### Performance Tests

1. Large dataset handling
2. Frequent save operations
3. Backup and restore performance

## Configuration Options

### File Location

- Data directory path
- Backup directory path
- Temporary directory path

### Behavior

- Number of backup copies to maintain
- Auto-save interval
- Validation strictness level

### Performance

- Buffer sizes for I/O operations
- Concurrency limits
- Cache settings
